Clustering is defined as an unsupervised learning where the objects are grouped on the basis of some similarity inherent among them. There are different methods for clustering the objects such as hierarchical, partitional, grid, density based and model based. The approaches used in these methods are discussed with their respective states of art and "

    "text": "Endogenous IRAK-M Attenuates Postinfarction Remodeling Through Effects on Macrophages and Fibroblasts 2598 Tissue necrosis triggers an intense inflammatory reaction that serves to clear the wound from dead cells and matrix debris, while activating reparative pathways. Because of the catastrophic consequences of excessive or prolonged inflammation on tissue architecture and organ function, repair of injured tissues requires timely activation of endogenous inhibitory pathways that restrain and suppress proinflammatory signals. Initially believed to be a passive process because of the dissipation of the injurious stimulus, it is now clear that suppression and resolution of the acute inflammatory response is a biosynthetically active response that requires activation of molecular mediators that inhibit the inflammatory reaction.1,2 Because the mammalian heart has negligible regenerative capacity, repair of the infarcted myocardium is dependent on the activation of an inflammatory reaction that ultimately results in the formation of a collagen-based scar. Perhaps more so than in any other tissue or type of injury, negative regulation of myocardial inflammation in the ischemic heart is o"

We report that in Mog-deficient mice (Mog–/–), the autoimmune response by transgenic T cells is redirected to a neuronal cytoskeletal self antigen, neurofilament-M (NF-M). Although components of radically different protein classes, the cross-reacting major histocompatibility complex I-Ab–restricted epitope sequences of MOG35–55 and NF-M18–30 share essential TCR contact positions. This pattern of cross-reaction is not specific to the transgenic TCR but is also commonly seen in MOG35–55–I-Ab–reactive T cells.

DOI: 10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.117.029622� February 13, 2018 707 BACKGROUND: Transforming growth factor–βs regulate a wide range of cellular responses by activating Smad-dependent and Smad-independent cascades. In the infarcted heart, Smad3 signaling is activated in both cardiomyocytes and interstitial cells. We hypothesized that cell-specific actions of Smad3 regulate repair and remodeling in the infarcted myocardium. METHODS: To dissect cell-specific Smad3 actions in myocardial infarction, we generated mice with Smad3 loss in activated fibroblasts or cardiomyocytes. Cardiac function was assessed after reperfused or nonreperfused infarction using echocardiography. The effects of cell-specific Smad3 loss on the infarcted heart were studied using histological studies, assessment of protein, and gene expression levels. In vitro, we studied Smad-dependent and Smadindependent actions in isolated cardiac fibroblasts. RESULTS: Mice with fibroblast-specific Smad3 loss had accentuated adverse remodeling after reperfused infarction and exhibited an increased incidence of "

Mostly the source code of web services is unavailable to other developers who use these services. The manual effort spent by them in testing these web services is very large in order to increase the interoperability. Thus, automated testing needs to be developed for testing these Web services. This paper reviews test cases for Web Services using reduction techniques Pair-Wise Testing (PWT) and Orthogonal Array Testing (OAT) and compares the two techniques with general method. The structure of Web Services is specified using UML diagrams. The pre and post conditions for the service rule are specified using Object Constraint Lang"

Neural networks have been very successful in a number of signal processing applications. We discuss fundamental limitations and inherent difficulties when using neural networks for the processing of high noise, small sample size signals. Financial forecasting employing neural networks is a highly significant area for exploratory study. It has long been known that exact prediction is more of an art than a science but attempts can be made to recognize trends and patterns which should help in predicting correctly within an order of magnitude. Our approach uses a typical back propagation neural net and employs various formulas on quantitative data. We picked our training stocks from different categories having varying prices a"

Kutty Center for Research in Engineering Sciences & Technology (CREST) KPIT Cummins Infosystems Ltd. Pune, India Abstract—There are many papers published on the use of 2D images for object representation. The fundamental issue with these approaches lies in the fact that a conventional image maps 3D real world objects into a 2D plane. This causes loss of 3D information - which means loss of 3D features as well for further analysis. There have been attempts using 3D and 2.5D scanners in order to access range data from objects for further analysis. However, these systems require special scanners and associated hardware, and many a times the complete information that is obtained from such systems is not required for further analysis. In this paper, we propose a simple system that projects a light beam over an object of interest and using a simple optical camera a video is recorded. This enables us to have 2"

Face recognition using depth map is an emerging field, which is trying to use 2D features along with the depth information of the face for accurate identification of the subject. In this paper, a 3D face recognition system is proposed where depth information of the face is captured by calculating the deviations in the scan pattern because of the non-planarity of the face.

These systems have applications in various domains like home or bank security, traffic monitoring, defense; and in public places like railway stations, malls, airports, etc. Our goal is to develop an intelligent real-time surveillance system that can help in increasing the efficiency of the system. In order to cover a large area, we need to install more number of cameras that leads to more number of videos that are to be monitored simultaneously. This in turn increases human intervention and makes it error prone. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to automate the complete system. In the proposed system, cameras are placed in such a way that there is a significant overlap between the field of view of the cameras. This helps in establishing an assoc"

In this paper, we have attempted to classify textual content from on-line Telugu newspapers using well known generative model. We have used generic features like contextual words and their part-of-speech (POS) to build the learning model. By understanding the syntax and grammar of Telugu language, we propose morphological pre-processing of the data and this step yields us better accuracy. We propose some interesting language dependent features like post-position feature, clue word feature and gazetteer feature to improve the performance of the model.

In this paper, we present a multiple kernel learning approach for the One-class Classification (OCC) task and employ it for anomaly detection. Recently, the basic multi-kernel approach has been proposed to solve the OCC problem, which is simply a convex combination of different kernels with equal weights. This paper proposes a Localized Multiple Kernel learning approach for Anomaly Detection (LMKAD) using OCC, where the weight for each kernel is assigned locally. Proposed LMKAD approach adapts the weight for each kernel using a gating function. The parameters of the gating function and one-class classifier are optimized simultaneously through a two-step optimization process. We present the empirical results of the performance of LMKAD on 25 benchmark datasets from various disciplines. This performance i"

But, traditional methods based one-class classifiers are very time consuming due to its iterative process and various parameters tuning. In this paper, we present six OCC methods and their thirteen variants based on extreme learning machine (ELM) and Online Sequential ELM (OSELM). Our proposed classifiers mainly lie in two categories: reconstruction based and boundary based, where three proposed classifiers belong to reconstruction based and three belong to boundary based. We are presenting both types of learning viz., online and offline learning for OCC. Out of six methods, four are offline and remaining two are online methods. Out of four offline methods, two methods perform random feature mapping and two methods perform kernel feature map"

This article applies change mining and evolution mining to evolving distributed systems. First, we propose a Service Change Classifier based Interface Slicing algorithm that mines change information from two versions of an evolving distributed system. To compare old and new versions, the following change classification labels are used: inserted, deleted, and modified. These labels are then used to identify subsets of the operations in our newly proposed Interface (WSDL) Slicing algorithm.

In order to provide quality delivery of delay sensitive services such as voice, video etc., it is required to route such traffic over a minimum delay path. In this paper we propose a routing metric for delay sensitive services in IEEE 802.16 mesh networks. We design a new cross layer routing metric, namely Expected Scheduler Delay (ESD), based on HoldOff exponent and the current load at each node of the network. This proposed metric takes into account the expected theoretical end-to-end delay of routing paths as well as network congestion to find the best suited path. We propose an efficient distributed scheme to calculate ESD and route the packets using source routing mechanism based on ESD. The simulation results demonstrate that our metric achieves reduced delay compared to a standard scheme used in IEEE 802.16 mesh, that takes hop count to find the path.

Abstract: The temporal extensions of the Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) model imposes duration constraints on the availability of roles by allowing periodic enabling and disabling of roles. For deploying these models, a set of roles having associated time constraints are required. Such type of roles are termed as temporal roles and the process of creating them is referred to as Temporal Role Mining. In many real-life scenarios, simply imposing time constraints on role availability may not be sufficient. The system administrator may need to ensure different types of constraints reflecting specific organizational policies. In this paper, we propose a cardinality constraint which restricts the maximum number of temporal roles that a user can activate in a particular time interval. We name this constraint as Temporal Role Assignment Constraint (TRAC). We formally define the problem of mining a minimal set of temporal roles in pre"

However, for organisations already having a deployed RBAC system, in many cases it may become necessary to associate a temporal dimension with the existing access control policies due to changing organisational requirements. In such cases, migration from RBAC to a temporal extension of RBAC becomes essential. Temporal RBAC (TRBAC) is one such RBAC extension. The process of creating a set of roles for implementi"

Implementation of ABAC requires the creation of a set of attribute-based rules which cumulatively form a policy. Designing an ABAC policy ab initio demands a substantial amount of effort from the system administrator. Moreover, organizational changes may necessitate the inclusion of new rules in an already deployed policy. In such a case, re-mining the entire ABAC policy will require a considerable amount of time and administrative effort. Instead, it is better to incrementally augment the policy.

This is because SC implementations that match the performance of relaxed memory models require post-retirement speculation and its associated hardware costs. In this paper we propose an efficient approach for enforcing SC without requiring post-retirement speculation. While prior SC implementations guarantee SC by explicitly completing memory operations within a processor in program order, we guarantee SC by completing conflicting memory operations, within and across processors, in an order that is consistent with the program order. More specifically, we identify those conflicting memory operations whose ordering is critical for the maintenance of SC and explicitly order them. This a"

Associate Professor Dept. of CSE, BMSCE Bangalore - 560019, India ABSTRACT The growing affluence of urban India has made the ownership of vehicles a necessity. This has resulted in an unexpected civic problem - that of traffic control and vehicle identification. Parking areas have become overstressed due to the growing numbers of vehicles on the roads today. The Automatic Number Plate Recognition System (ANPR) plays an important role in addressing these issues as its application ranges from parking admission to monitoring urban traffic and to tracking automobile thefts. There are numerous ANPR systems available today which are based on different methodologies. In this paper, we attempt to review the various te"

Tayal Received: 7 June 2013 / Accepted: 14 January 2014 / Published online: 4 February 2014 © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2014 Abstract In order to improve the retrieval performance, the query is reformulated by the process of Query expansion (QE). Most of the existing query expansion techniques do not consider the context of the terms present in the user’s query which can result in low precision and recall. Through this paper, the query consisting of ambiguous terms (polysemy words) is expanded by selecting the terms, which are in close proximity to the query terms while context meaning of the terms is automatically incorporated. The basis of this query expansion method is to investigate the role of graph structure (which is being created for the query) and determining the importance of each node in the graph using WordNet. The relevant nodes representing word senses are identified from the graph and can be chosen as additional terms to be added to the query fo"

First module, DE extracts the unstructured crime dataset from various crime Web sour ces, during the period of 2000–2012. Second module, DP cleans, integrates and reduces the extracted crime data into structured 5,038 crime instances. We represent these instances using 35 predefined crime attributes. Safeguard measures are taken for the crime database accessibility. Rest four modules are useful for crime detection, criminal identification and prediction, and crime verification, respectively.

    "text": "Microsoft Word - v2-1-1.doc Abstract—The join dependency provides the basis for obtaining lossless join decomposition in a classical relational schema. The existence of Join dependency shows that that the tables always represent the correct data after being joined. Since the classical relational databases cannot handle imprecise data, they were extended to fuzzy relational databases so that uncertain, ambiguous, imprecise and partially known information can also be stored in databases in a formal way. However like classical databases, the fuzzy relational databases also undergoes decomposition during normalization, the issue of joining the decomposed fuzzy relations remains intact. Our effort in the present paper is to emphasize on this issue. In this paper we define fuzzy join dependency in the framework of type-1 fuzzy relational databases & type-2 fuzzy relational databases using the concept of fuzzy equality which is defined using fuzzy functions. We use the fuzzy equi-join operator for computing the fuzzy equality of two attribute values. We also discuss the dependency preservation property on execution of this fuzzy equi- join and derive the necessary condition for the fuzzy "

This is a pervasive problem in scientific data. Due to skewness, the uneven distribution of attributes occurs, and it can cause a severe load imbalance problem.When database join operations are applied to these datasets, skewness occurs exponentially. All the algorithms developed to date for the implementation of database joins are highly skew sensitive.

BL-MENE utilizes several baseline features for the NER task but suffers from inaccurate named-entity (NE) boundary detection, misclassification errors, and the partial recognition of NEs due to certain missing essentials. However, the CP-MENE-based NER task incorporates extensive features and patterns that are set to overcome these problems. In fact, CP-MENE’s features include right-boundary, left-boundary, part-of-speech, synonym, gazetteer and relative pronoun features. CP-MENE formulates a kind of recursive relationship for extracting highly ranked NE patterns that are generated through regular expressions via Python@ code.

Bhatia3 *1,3 Faculty,CSE, NSUT, Delhi, India 2 Faculty, CSE, IGDTUW, Delhi, India Abstract The paper presents a scalable and generalized approach to social network analysis using fuzzy graph theory. In this, we propose an intelligent sociocentric approach that calculates the degree of potential relationship of a social network of finite size by proposing a fuzzy graph social network model. It takes into account social entity functional and relational attributes simultaneously. In this, the degree of potential relationship of a social network is computed by using two steps. In the first step, the fuzzy pairwise relationship between all social nodes or entities is computed using the proposed fuzzy node activeness index parameter with their online and offline communication relationship parameters. In the second step, all fuzzy pairwise relationships calculated in the first step are further employed to calculate the degree of potential relationship of a social network using an astute function utilizing both weighted "

Tayal Associate Professor IGDTUW, Delhi-110006 Leena Ahuja Ex-Student IGDTUW, Delhi-110006 Shreya Chhabra Ex-Student IGDTUW, Delhi-110006 Abstract The problem of Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) can be defined as the task of assigning the most appropriate sense to the polysemous word within a given context. Many supervised, unsupervised and semi-supervised approaches have been devised to deal with this problem, particularly, for the English language. However, this is not the case for Hindi language, where not much work has been done. In this paper, a new approach has been developed to perform disambiguation in Hindi language. For training the system, the text in Hindi language is converted into Hyperspace Analogue to Language (HAL) vectors, thereby, mapping each word into a high-dimensional space. We also deal with the fuzziness involved in disambiguation"

In this work a novel structural obfuscation methodology for protecting a digital signal processor (DSP) IP core at the architectural synthesis design stage. The proposed approach specifically targets protection of IP cores that involve complex loops. Five different algorithmic level transformation techniques are employed: loop unrolling, loop invariant code motion, tree height reduction/increment, logic transformation and redundant operation removal.

Mohanty , Senior Member, IEEE, and Peter Corcoran, Fellow, IEEE Abstract—A novel approach for obfuscated JPEG compression/decompression (CODEC) IP core design methodology, suitable for use in re-usable IP core designs, is presented. This incorporates structural obfuscation for architecture or structure hiding from an adversary in order to maximize the complexity against reverse engineering. Additionally, the proposed methodology performs the entire compression and decompression through a single dedicated hardware IP core. To obtain a lightweight (low cost version) of the proposed obfuscated JPEG CODEC IP, particle swarm optimization driven design space exploration is employed. Results of the proposed low cost, obfuscated JPEG CODEC IP core design when compared to unprotected (un-obfuscated) design yielded enhancement in strength of obfuscation of 76%, as well as reduction of 5% compared to un-optimize"

Mohanty Computer Science and Engineering University of North Texas, Denton, USA saraju.mohanty@unt.edu Abstract—The design process of smart Consumer Electronics (CE) devices heavily relies on reusable Intellectual Property (IP) cores of Digital Signal Processor (DSP) and Multimedia Processor (MP). On the other hand, due to strict competition and rivalry between IP vendors, the problem of ownership conflict and IP piracy is surging. Therefore, to design a secured smart CE device, protection of DSP/MP IP core is essential. Embedding a robust IP owner’s signature can protect an IP core from ownership abuse and forgery. This paper presents a covert signature embedding process for DSP/MP IP core at Register-transfer level (RTL). The secret marks of the signature are distributed over the entire design such that it provides higher robustness. For example for 8th order FIR fil"

Sengupta✉ and D. Roy ELECT aded from https://ietresearch.onlinelibrary.w iley.com /doi/10.1049/el.2017 For protecting an intellectual property (IP) core, it must be harder to reverse engineer. Structural obfuscation can play an important role in achieving this goal. A novel structural obfuscation methodology during architectural synthesis using multiple compiler-based highlevel transformations (HLTs) that yield functionally equivalent designs (data flow graphs) which are camouflaged in identity is proposed. The proposed obfuscation methodology is driven through a number of HLT techniques such as redundant operation elimination, logic transformation and tree height transformation. In addition to performing obfuscation, performing area–delay tradeoff during exploring low-cost obfuscated design is also possible using these HLT techniques in the proposed methodology. Owing to multiple stages of HLT incorporated in the proposed approach during obfuscation, it yields a highly robust design which"

This paper introduces a novel 7 variable signature encoding driven triple-phase watermarking methodology during high level synthesis (HLS)/architectural synthesis for IP core protection of vendor rights. The proposed approach is extremely robust against external threats as it involves vendor signature comprising of 7-variable combination embedded through three independent phases of high level synthesis. This research is the first work in the HLS literature that presents a triple-phase watermarking process during HLS compared to single phase watermarking techniques so far. The proposed approach incurs zero delay overhead and minimal hardware overhead while embedding as well as yields average cost reductions of 7.38 % and 6.25 % compared to two similar approaches. Further, the proposed triple-phase watermark approach achieves a lower Pc value by ~3.2*1027 times in magnitude compar"

Specifically, we demonstrate improvements over prior approaches utilizing a compression-decompression network by introducing: (a) an edge-aware loss function to prevent blurring that is commonly occurred in prior works & (b) a super-resolution convolutional neural network (CNN) for postprocessing along with a corresponding pre-processing network for improved rate-distortion performance in the low rate regime. The algorithm is assessed on a variety of datasets varying from low to high resolution namely Set 5, Set 7, Classic 5, Set 14, Live 1, Kodak, General 100, CLIC 2019. When compared to JPEG, JPEG2000, BPG, and recent CNN approach, the proposed algorithm contributes significant improvement in PSNR with an approximate gain of 20.75%, 8.47%, 3.22%, 3.23% and 24.59%, 1"

This is usually done ‘by hand’, taking several days or week of iterative repair and after feedback from students complaining that the time table is unfair to them in some way. Which we in this research tried solving through conventional method (Result shows that the problem of conventional method) but at a certain level we recognized that solving timetabling problem with increased constraints is very difficult by conventional methods.

Chapter 16 DOI: 10.4018/978-1-4666-9474-3.ch016 ABSTRACT Formal learning has shifted from the confines of institutional walls to our home computers and even to our mobiles. It is often felt that the concept of e-learning can be successfully applied to theoretical sub jects but when it comes to teaching of science subjects like chemistry where hands on practical training is must, it is inadequate. This chapter presents a hybrid approach (amalgamation of concepts of machine learning technique with soft computing paradigm) to develop an intelligent virtual chemistry laboratory (IVCL) tool for simulating chemical experiments online. Tool presents an easy to use web based interface, which takes as input the reactants and presents results in the form of - type of reaction occurred and the list of possible products. Technically, the IVCL tool utilizes naïve bayes algorithm to classify the type of reactions and then applies genetic algorithm inspired approach to generate the products.

The existing algorithms for community detection depend chiefly on the network topologies and are not effective for such sparse graphs. Thus, there is a great need to optimize those algorithms. Evolutionary algorithms have emerged as a promising solution for optimized approximation of hard problems. We propose to optimize the community detection method based on modularity and normalized mutual information (NMI) using the latest grey wolf optimization algorithm. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithms, when compared with other contemporary evolutionary algorithms.

In today’s era, organizations are developing applications which continuously and rapidly generates large amount of data. In this world of big data, NoSQL databases are rapidly becoming popular for storing information among organizations. Therefore, it is essential for an organization to choose a database which is compatible and efficient for their applications. To choose a correct data‐ base, it is essential to examine the performance of various databases under diverse workload conditions. In this paper, we are examining different document oriented databases on various workloads, so that we can categorize them according to application need. The evaluation has been performed on four NoSQL document oriented databases: MongoDB, ArangoDB, Elastic search and OrientDB with the help of Yahoo Cloud Service Benchmark (YCSB), which is a popular benchmark tool.

This inspires the researchers to work in the area of information diffusion, i.e., spread of information through “word of mouth” effect. Information maximization is an important research problem of information diffusion, i.e., selection of k most influential nodes in the network such that they can maximize the information spread. In this paper, we proposed an influence maximization model that identifies optimal seeds to maximize the influence spread in the network. Our proposed algorithm is a hybrid approach, i.e., GA with k-medoid approach using dynamic edge strength. To analyze the efficiency of the proposed algorithm, experiments are performed on two large-scale datasets using fitness score measure. Experimental outcome illustrated 8–16% increment in influence propagation by proposed algorithm as compared to existing seed selection methods, i.e., general greedy, random, discounted degree, and high degree.

It enhances the compu tation capabilities of mobile nodes and IoT (Internet of Things) devices by providing compute and storage capabilities similar to the cloud but at a lower latency and using lesser bandwidth. Additional advantages of fog computing include its support for node mobility, context awareness, reliability and scalability. Due to its multiple benefits, fog computing is used for offloading tasks from applications executing on end devices. This allows faster execution of applications using the capabilities of fog nodes. However, the task offloading problem in the fog environment is chal lenging due to the dynamic nature of fog environment and multiple QoS (Quality of Service) parameters dependent on the application being executed. Therefore, the chapter proposes a QoS-aware task offloading strategy using a novel nature-inspired optimization algorithm, known as the Smart Flower Optimization Algorithm (SFOA). The proposed strat"

The need to adapt to this new reality is obvious and is bound to have a long lasting influence on the software industry. This fosters the industry and researchers to look for intelligent supporting technologies and tools that can help interconnect and exchange Software Engineering knowledge. A rising trend to exploit ontologies for sharing and reusing information across web is well recognized. We examine the strategic alignment of ontologies to Software Engineering where the former can be used to improve and assist in intelligent software development process.

This paper uses a dataset that consists of over 1500 cryptocurrencies with their prices starting from their initiation till May, 2018. A lot of the effort went into getting the data set ready before predicting the future prices of all the cryptocurrencies, i.e., making sure that the cryptocurrencies were stationary time-series. Beginning with learning about the ARIMA model and the conditions to run the model successfully, first validation of the model is done. An average accuracy of 86.424 is observed for 95% of the currencies are observed. After this validation, forecasting is performed on these cryptocurrencies and the percentage change of the price is calculated. 1. I"

The group key agreement protocol enables to derive a shared session key for the remote members to communicate securely. Recently, several attempts are made to utilize group key agreement protocols for s ecure multicasting in Internet of Things. This paper contributes to identify the security vulnerabilities in the existing protocols, to avoid them in future constructions. The protocols presented by Gupta and Biswas have been found insecure to ephemeral secret key leakage (ESL) attack and also, malicious insiders can impersonate an honest participant. Additionally, the protocol presented by Tan is also ESL-insecure. We also present a fix to the Tan’s protocol to make it secure.

For the same, literature has witnessed that medical imaging plays a vital role, and tools using supervised methods have promising results. However, the limited size of medical images for diagnosis of CoVID19 may impact the generalization of such supervised methods. To alleviate this, a new clustering method is presented. In this method, a novel variant of a gravitational search algorithm is employed for obtaining optimal clusters. To validate the performance of the proposed variant, a comparative analysis among recent metaheuristic algorithms is conducted.

We propose a new method of generating the fuzzy if-then rules specific to a given image based on the local information available to be used by a fuzzy inference system. To this end, we only generate a partial histogram and not a complete histogram thus saving on computational costs. We also give a compartive study of our approach and some classical and existing fuzzy techniques, and show that the enhanced images from the proposed algorithm are comparable.

Balasubramaniam, Student Member, IEEE and C. Jagan Mohan Rao Abstract—In this paper, we explore the distributivity of implication operators (especially PLEASE DEFINE R R- and Sugeno (S)-implication) over Takagi (T)- and S-norms. The motivation behind this work is the on going discussion on the law [( ) ] [( ) ( )] in fuzzy logic as given in the title of the paper by Trillas and Alsina. The above law is only one of the four basic distributive laws. The general form of the previous distributive law is ( ( ) ) ( ( ) ( )). Similarly, the other three basic distributive laws can be generalized to give equations concerning distribution of fuzzy implications on T- and Snorms. In this paper, we study the validity of these equations under various conditions on the implication operator . We also propose some sufficiency conditions on a binary operator under which the general distributive equations are reduced to the basic distributive equations and are satisfied. Also in this work, we have solved one of the open problems posed by M. Baczynski (200"

The compositional rule of inference (CRI), which was introduced by Zadeh, has attracted the most attention so far. In this paper, we show that the FRI scheme that is based on the Bandler–Kohout (BK) subproduct, along with a suitable realization of the fuzzy rules, possesses all the important properties that are cited in favor of using CRI, viz., equivalent and reasonable conditions for their solvability, their interpolative properties, and the preservation of the indistinguishability that may be inherent in the input fuzzy sets. Moreover, we show that under certain conditions, the equivalence of first-infer-then-aggregate (FITA) and first-aggregate-then-infer (FATI) inference strategies can be shown for the BK subproduct, much like in the case of CRI. Finally, by addressing the computational complexity that may "

The presented proofs make no assumption on the form or representations of the considered fuzzy implications and hence show that a much larger class of fuzzy implications other than what is typically considered in the literature can be employed meaningfully in FRIs based on implicative models.

However, both algorithms have been applied to various science and engineering optimization problems, extensively, the algorithms suffer from premature convergence, unbalanced exploration-exploitation, and sometimes slow convergence speed. Hybridization of ABC and DE may provide a platform for developing a meta-heuristic algorithm with better convergence speed and a better balance between exploration and exploitation capabilities. This paper proposes a hybridization of ABC and DE algorithms to develop a more efficient meta-heuristic algorithm than ABC and DE. In the proposed hybrid algorithm, Hybrid Artificial Bee Colony with Differential Evolution (HABCDE), the onlooker bee phase of ABC is inspired from DE.

This is done by replacing two terms of original velocity update equation by two new terms based on the linear combination of pbest and gbest. Its performance is compared with the standard PSO (SPSO) by testing it on a set of 15 scalable and 15 nonscalable test problems. Based on the numerical and graphical analyses of results it is shown that the MeanPSO outperforms the SPSO, in terms of efficiency, reliability, accuracy and stability.

In this paper, a new approach for numerical optimization is proposed by modeling the foraging behavior of spider monkeys. Spider monkeys have been categorized as fission–fusion social structure based animals. The animals which follow fission– fusion social systems, split themselves from large to smaller groups and vice-versa based on the scarcity or availability of food. The proposed swarm intelligence approach is named as Spider Monkey Optimization (SMO) algorithm and can broadly be classified as an algorithm inspired by intelligent foraging behavior "

China bDepartment of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY 40292, U.S. Abstract Weight decay method as one of classical complexity regularizations is simple and appears to work well in some applications for backpropagation neural networks (BPNN). This paper shows results for the weak and strong convergence for cyclic and almost cyclic learning BPNN with penalty term (CBP-P and ACBP-P). The convergence is guaranteed under certain relaxed conditions for activation functions, learning rate and under the assumption for the stationary set of error function. Furthermore, the boundedness of the weights in the training procedure is obtained in a simple and clear way. Numerical simulations are implemented to support our theoretical results and demonstrate that ACBP-P has better performance than CBP-P on both convergence speed and generalization ability.

The penalty term of the presented neural networks stems from the Group Lasso method which selects hidden variables in a grouped manner. To deal with the non-differentiability of the original penalty term (l1-l2 norm) and avoid oscillations, smoothing techniques have been used to approximate the objective function. It is assumed that the training samples are supplied to the networks in a specific incremental way during training, that is, in each cycle samples are supplied in a fi"

It is assumed that the training samples are supplied to the network in a cyclic or an almost-cyclic fashion in the learning procedure, i.e., in each training cycle, each sample of the training set is supplied in a fixed or a stochastic order respectively to the network exactly once. A restart strategy for the momentum is adopted such that the momentum coefficient is set to zero at the beginning of each training cycle. Corresponding weak and strong convergence results are then proved, indicating that the gradient of the error function goes to zero and the weight sequence goes to a fixed point, respectively. The convergence conditions on the learning rate, the momentum coefficient, and the activation functions are much relaxed compared with those of the existing results.

The deterministic convergence for a Double Parallel Feedforward Neural Network (DPFNN) is studied. DPFNN is a parallel connection of a multi-layer feedforward neural network and a single layer feedforward neural network. Gradient method is used for training DPFNN with finite training sample set. The monotonicity of the error function in the training iteration is proved. Then, some weak and strong convergence results are obtained, in dicating that the gradient of the error function tends to zero and the weight sequence goes to a fixed point, respectively. Numerical examples are provided, which support our theoretical findings and demonstrate that DPFNN has faster convergence speed and better generalization capability than the common feed forward neural network.

In this article, the researcher develops an image coding technique which is based on the wolf-sheep predation model. In the design, images are converted to virtual worlds of sheep, routes and wolves. Wolves in this model wander around searching for sheep while the algorithm tracks their movement. A wolf has seven movements which capture all the directions of the wolf. In addition, the researcher introduces one extra move of the wolf the purpose of which is to provide a shorter string of movements and to enhance the compression ratio. The first coordinates and the movements of the wolf are tracked and recorded. Then, arithmetic coding is applied on the string of movements to further compress it. The algorithm was applied on a set of images and the results were compared with other algorithms in the research community. The experimental results reveal that the size of the compressed string of wolf movements offer a higher reduction in space and the compression ratio is higher than those of many "

Keywords: Ant Colonies, Pheromone, Proximity, Binary Images, Arithmetic Coding. Abstract: Ant colonies emerged as a topic of research and they are applied in different fields. In this paper, we develop an algorithm based on the concept of ant colonies and we utilize if for image coding and compression. To apply the algorithm on images, we represent each image as a virtual world which contains food and routes for ants to walk and search for it. Ants in the algorithm have certain type of movements depending on when and where they find food. When an ant finds food, it releases a pheromone, which allows other ants to follow the source of food. This increases the likelihood that food areas are covered. The chemical evaporates after a certain amount of time, which in turn helps ants move to cover another food "

In this paper, we utilize the NetLogo HIV model in constructing an environment for bi-level image encoding and employ it in compression. Our model considers converting an image into a virtual environment that comprises female agents testing positive and negative for HIV. Female agents are scattered according to the allocation of the pixels in the original images to be tested. The simulation considers introducing male agents that test positive for HIV, the purpose of which is to track their movements while infecting other HIV- female agents. The progressions of the HIV+ male agents within the simulation take advantage of the relative encoding approach previously used by other image processing and agent-based modeling researchers. That is to say, the simulation allows generating a high proportion of similar movement forms that ar"

Many researchers have worked in the field of incorporating emotions in a cognitive agent. However, each model has its own merits and demerits. Moreover, most studies on emotion focus on steady-state emotions than emotion switching. Thus, in this article, a domain-independent computational model of emotions for intelligent agent is proposed that have modules for emotion elicitation, emotion regulation, and emotion transition. The model is built on some well-known psychological theories such as appraisal theories of emotions, emotion regulation theory, and multistore human memory model. The design of the model is using the concept of fuzzy logic to handle uncertain and subjective information. The main focus is on primary emotions as suggested by Ekman; however, simultaneous elicitation of multiple emotions (called secondary emotion) is also supported by the model.

For the last few decades, many researchers are working in the field of incorporating emotions in a virtual agent. In the emotion model, the behavior of an agent depends upon how the event is perceived by the agent with respect to the goal. Hence, perception of the event while considering the past experience, importance of event towards achieving goal, agent’s own capabilities and resources is an important process which directly influences the decision making and action selection. The proposed models, till date, are either too complex to adapt or are using a very few parameters to describe the event. So, in this paper, we propose an extension of perception process in an existing emotion model, EMIA and suggest the formalization of event perception and appraisal processes to make it adaptable. This has been carried out using five parameters for event description along-with fuzzy logic which makes t"

Transporters expect them to work at least twenty or more hours per day continuously without any consideration to their health. This leads them to have bursts of micro sleep, a temporary episode of sleepiness which may last for a smidgen of a second or up to 30 seconds, where the victim fails to react to some stimulus from the environment and becomes unconscious. As a result of this, road accidents have become a common occurrence in India. One solution to this problem is to enhance the vehicles to an extent, so that it is possible to determine the drowsiness of the driver in real time. In this project, we propose a system to assist a driver th"

Generating the maximum number of such cover sets has been proved to be an NP-complete problem, and thus algorithms producing suboptimal solutions have been proposed. This paper proposes an efficient method to extend the sensor network operational time by organizing the sensors into a maximal number of non-disjoint sensor covers that are activated successively. Only the sensors from the current active sensor cover are responsible for monitoring all targets and for transmitting the collected data, while nodes from all other sensor covers are in a low-energy sleep mode.

In order to enhance the global network lifetime, one should need to utilise the available sensors’ energy in an optimise way. There are several approaches discussed in the literature to maximise the network lifetime for wellknown target coverage problem in WSN. The target coverage problem is presented as a maximum network lifetime problem (MLP) and solved heuristically using various approaches. In this study, the authors propose a genetic algorithm (GA)-"

A sensor covers targets which are within the sensing range. For a set of sensors and a set of targets, the sensor-target coverage relationship is assumed to be known. A sensor cover is a set of sensors that covers all the targets. The target coverage problem is to determine a set of sensor covers with maximum aggregated lifetime while constraining the life of each sensor by its initial battery life. The problem is proved to be NP-complete and heuristic algorithms to solve this problem are proposed. In the present study, we give a unified interpretation of ea"

Coverage maintenance can be prolonged by using the network energy efficiently, which can be done by keeping sufficient number of sensors in sensor covers. There has been discussed a Coverage-Preserving Clustering Protocol (CPCP) to increase the network lifetime in clustered WSNs. It selects sensors for various roles such as cluster heads and sensor cover members by considering various coverage aware cost metrics. In this paper, we propose a new heuristic called Improved-Coverage-Preserving Clustering Protocol (I-CPCP) to maximize the total network lifetime.

    "text": "IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION FORENSICS AND SECURITY 1 Camera Fingerprint Extraction via Spatial Domain Averaged Frames Samet Taspinar, Manoranjan Mohanty, and Nasir Memon Abstract—Photo Response Non-Uniformity (PRNU) based camera attribution is an effective method to determine the source camera of visual media (an image or a video). To apply this method, images or videos need to be obtained from a camera to create a “camera fingerprint” which then can be compared against the PRNU of the query media whose origin is under question. The fingerprint extraction process can be time consuming when a large number of video frames or images have to be denoised. This may need to be done when the individual images have been subjected to high compression or other geometric processing such as video stabilization. This paper investigates a simple, yet effective and efficient technique to create a camera fingerprint when so many still images need to be denoised. The technique utilizes Spatial Domain Averaged (SDA) frames. An SDA-frame is the arithmetic mean of multiple still images. When it is used for fingerprint extraction, the number of denoising operations can be significantly decreased wi"

IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON DEPENDABLE AND SECURE COMPUTING 1 e-PRNU: Encrypted Domain PRNU-Based Camera Attribution for Preserving Privacy* Manoranjan Mohanty, Ming Zhang, Muhammad Rizwan Asghar, and Giovanni Russello Abstract—Photo Response Non-Uniformity (PRNU) noise-based source camera attribution is a popular digital forensic method. In this method, a camera fingerprint computed from a set of known images of the camera is matched against the extracted noise of an anonymous questionable image to find out if the camera had taken the anonymous image. The possibility of privacy leak, however, is one of the main concerns of the PRNU-based method. Using the camera fingerprint (or the extracted noise), an adversary can identify the owner of the camera by matching the fingerprint with the"

ABSTRACT Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is an emerging area of research in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI). XAI can explain how AI obtained a particular solution (e.g., classification or object detection) and can also answer other \"wh\" questions. This explainability is not possible in traditional AI. Explainablity is essential for critical applications, such as defence, health care, law and order, and autonomous driving vehicles, etc, where the know how is required for trust and transparency. A number of XAI techniques so far have been purposed for such applications. This paper provides an overview of these techniques from a multimedia (i.e., text, image, audio, and video) point of view. Advantages and shortcomings of these techniques have been discu"

Recently, the video conferencing tool Zoom has become extremely popular for its simple-to-use feature and low network bandwith requirement. However, Zoom has serious security and privacy issues. Due to weak authentication mechanisms, unauthorized persons are invading Zoom sessions and creating disturbances (known as Zoom bombing). In this paper, we propose a preliminary work towards a seamless authentication mechanism for Zoom-based teaching and meeting. Our method is based on PRNU (Photo Response Non Uniformity)-based camera authentication, which can authenticate the camera of a device used in a Zoom meeting without requiring any assistance from the participants (e.g., needing the participant to provide biometric).

Related literature on virtualization in WSNs explored resource optimization without considering communication failure in WSNs environments. The failure of a communication link in WSNs impacts many virtual networks running IoT services. In this context, this paper proposes a framework for optimizing fault tolerance in virtualization in WSNs, focusing on heterogeneous networks for service-oriented IoT applications. An optimization problem is formulated considering fault tolerance and communication delay as two conflicting objectives. An adapted non-dominated sorting based genetic algorithm (A-NSGA) is developed to solve the optimization problem.

ARP poisoning is used when a host is used to poison ARP cache of another host in order to send packets to some other destination than the intended one. This paper presents a feasible technique to detect and prevent the ARP poisoning by removing the multiple entries for the same MAC address or IP address from the ARP table using a secondary cache. This secondary cache contains the entries according to Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) responses. Since this technique prevents multiple entries for same IP address or MAC address, it also mitigates IP exhaustion problem. The secondary cache is maintained at every host which makes this technique distributed in nature, thereby prevents it from single point failure. Experimental results are also provided to support the proposal. Keywords - Address Resolution Protocol, ARP Poisoning, IP Exhaustion, Man-in-the-Middle, ICMP, Network Security, Cyber Defense I.

Wireless sensor networks have several important attributes that require special attention to device design. These include the need for inexpensive, long-lasting, highly reliable devices coupled with very low performance requirements. Ultimately, the “holy grail” of this design space is a truly untethered device that operates off of energy scavenged from the ambient environment. In this paper, we describe an application-driven approach to the architectural design and implementation of a wireless sensor device that recognizes the event-driven nature of many sensor-network workloads. We have developed a full-system simulator for our sensor node design to verify and explore our architecture. Our simulation results suggest one to two orders of magnitude reduct"

Several entities on the Internet do follow this principle. For instance, in this work, we show that many popular web servers on the Internet are generous as they wait for a substantial time period to receive the remaining portion of an incomplete web request. Unfortunately, this behavior also makes them vulnerable to a class of cyber attacks, commonly known as Slow Rate DoS attacks. HTTP/2, the recent version of HTTP, is recently found vulnerable to these attacks. However, the impact of Slow HTTP/2 DoS attacks on real web servers on the Internet has not been studied yet. Also, to the best of our knowledge, there is no defense scheme known to detect Slow Rate DoS attacks against HTTP/2 in real-time. To bridge these gaps, we first test the behavior of HTTP/2 supporting web servers on the Internet against Slow HTTP/2 DoS attacks. Subsequently, we pro"

The Android OS Power Manager provides programming interface routines called wakelocks for controlling the activation state of devices on a mobile system. An appropriate placement of wakelock acquire and release functions in the application can make a significant difference to the energy consumption. In this paper, we propose a data flow analysis based strategy for determining the placement of wakelock statements corresponding to the uses of devices in an application. Our experimental evaluation on a set of Android applications show significant (up to 32%) energy savings with the proposed optimization strategy. I.

Lack of economy and basic education has been monitored as a cause for majority of child labor activities. It is being generally realized that, child labor especially in hazardous occupation is one of the worst social evil and has to be eliminated at the earliest. Government has been taking various pro-active measures to tackle this problem. However, considering the magnitude and extent of the problem and that it is essentially a socioeconomic problem inextricably linked to poverty and illiteracy, it requires concerted efforts from all sections of the society to make a dent in t"

Given the increasing design complexity and time-to-market pressures, figuring out the registers which do not require resets is extremely challenging. In this paper, we present a novel algorithm which uses observability based sequential analysis to identify the registers in design which do not require resets. With the proposed algorithm, we have seen that in some cases 70% registers in the design can have redundant resets. Further, with removal of the redundant resets on registers up to 22% sequential p"

A second order robotic manipulator system has been modeled into a general nonlinear input affine system. Initially, the global asymptotic stability is ensured with conventional periodic sampling approach for reference trajectory tracking. Then the proposed approach of event-triggered sliding mode control is discussed which guarantees semi-global uniform ultimate boundedness. The proposed control approach guarantees non-accumulation of control updates ensuring lower bounds on inter-event triggering instants avoiding Zeno behavior in presence of the disturbance. The system shows better performance in terms of reduced control updates, ensures system stability which further guarantees optimization of resource usage and cost.

The proposed clustering technique is equipped with major changes and modifications in its previous versions of algorithm. SOC is compared with some of the widely used clustering techniques such as K-means, fuzzy C-means, Expectation and Maximization, and K-medoid. Also, the comparison of the proposed technique is shown with IMC and its last updated version. The quantitative and qualitative performances of all these well-known clustering techniques are presented and compared with the aid of case studies and examples on various benchmarked validation indices. SOC has been evaluated via cluster compactness within itself and separation with other clusters. The optimizing factor in the threshold function is computed via interpolation and found to be effective in forming better quality clusters "

In this paper, a quantum based binary neural network algorithm is proposed, named as novel quantum binary neural network algorithm (NQ-BNN). It forms a neural network structure by deciding weights and separability parameter in quantum based manner. Quantum computing concept represents solution proba bilistically and gives large search space to find optimal value of required parameters using Gaussian random number generator. The neural network structure forms constructively having three number of layers input layer: hidden layer and output layer. A constructive way of deciding the network eliminates the unnecessary training of neural network. A new parameter that is a quantum separability parameter (QSP) is introduced here, which finds an optimal separability plane to classify input samples. During learning,"

Clustering a high-dimensional protein sequence dataset using traditional machine learning approaches poses many challenges. Many different feature extraction methods exist and are widely used. However, extracting features from millions of protein sequences becomes impractical because they are not scalable with current algorithms. Therefore, there is a need for an efficient feature extraction approach that extracts significant features. We have proposed two scalable feature extraction approaches for extracting features from huge protein sequences using Apache Spark, which are termed 60d-SPF (60-dimensional Scalable Protein Feature) and 6d-SCPSF (6-dimensional Scalable Co-occurrence-based Probability-Specific Featur"

Lot of research has gone into understanding the composition and nature of proteins, still many things remain to be understood satisfactorily. It is now generally believed that amino acid sequences of proteins are not random, and thus the patterns of amino acids that we observe in the protein sequences are also non-random. In this study, we have attempted to decipher the nature of associations between different amino acids that are present in a protein. This very basic analysis provides insights into the co-occurrence of certain amino acids in a protein. Such association rules are desirable for enhancing our understanding of protein composition and hold the potential to give clues regarding the global interactions amongst some particular sets of amino acid"

Pal, Fellow, IEEE and Pabitra Mitra, Student Member, IEEE, Abstract—The problem of segmentation of multispectral satellite images is addressed. An integration of rough-set-theoretic knowledge extraction, the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm, and minimal spanning tree (MST) clustering is described. EM provides the statistical model of the data and handles the associated measurement and representation uncertainties. Rough-set theory helps in faster convergence and in avoiding the local minima problem, thereby enhancing the performance of EM. For rough-set-theoretic rule generation, each band is discretized using fuzzy-correlation-based gray-level thresholding. MST enables determination of nonconvex clusters. Since this is applied on Gaussians, determined by granules, rather than on the original data points, time required is very low. These features are demonstrated on two IR"

A support vector machine (SVM) is considered for classifying the pixels into different landcover types. It is initially designed using a small set of labeled points, and subsequently refined by actively querying for the labels of pixels from a pool of unlabeled data. The label of the most interesting/ ambiguous unlabeled point is queried at each step. Here, active learning is exploited to minimize the number of labeled data used by the SVM classifier by several orders. These features are demonstrated on an IRS-1A four band multi spectral image.

The PV system is integrated to grid through a voltage source inverter (VSI), in which PVVSI combination supplies active power and compensates reactive power of the local non-linear load connected to the point of common coupling (PCC). For extraction of maximum power from the PV panel, we develop a RL based maximum power point tracking (MPPT) algorithm. The instantaneous power theory (IPT) is adopted for generation reference inverter current (RIC). An SMC algorithm has been developed for injecting current to the local non-linear load at a reference value.

The GWO is a new optimization method which overcomes the limitations such as lower tracking efficiency, steady-state oscillations, and transients as encountered in perturb and observe (P&O) and improved PSO (IPSO) techniques. The problem of tracking the global peak (GP) of a PV array under partial shading conditions (PSCs) is attempted employing the GWO-based MPPT technique. The proposed scheme is studied for a PV array under PSCs which exhibits multiple peaks and its tracking performance is compared with that of two MPPT algorithms, namely P&O-MPPT and IPSOMPPT. The proposed GWO-MPPT algorithm is implemented on a PV system using MATLAB/SIMULINK. Furthermore, an experimental setup is developed to verify the efficacy of the proposed system. From the"

This ASMC algorithm minimizes the difference between the reference inverter current and the actual inverter current of the grid connected PV system (GCPVS) during unbalanced loading, grid voltage distortion and variation in solar irradiance. The maximum output power from the PV panel is obtained using modified incremental conductance (IC) MPPT algorithm. Instantaneous power theory (IPT) is employed to transfer active power and reactive power between the PV system, grid and the non-linear load. The ASMC-IC-IPT control scheme is applied to a grid connected PV system firstly using simulation and then on a prototype experimental setup. The performance of ASMC-IC-IPT scheme is compared with that of sliding mode control (SMC)-IC-IPT scheme. From the obtained results, it is observed that ASMC-IC-IPT control scheme outperforms the SMC-IC-IPT control scheme during transient, steady state and dynamic loading conditions.

Groen Abstract The paper presents a dynamic modelling technique for a manipulator with multiple flexible links and flexible joints, based on a combined Euler–Lagrange formulation and assumed modes method. The resulting generalised model is validated through computer simulations by considering a simplified case study of a two-link flexible manipulator with joint elasticity. Controlling such a manipulator is more complex than controlling one with rigid joints because only a single actuation signal can be applied at each joint and this has to control the flexure of both the joint itself and the link attached to it. To resolve the control complexities associated with such an under-actuated flexible link/flexible joint manipulator, a singularly perturbed model has been formulated and used to design "

In this scenario, proper estimation of such harmonics is intended to maintain power quality and improved operation of the system. It is also desirable that the estimation technique should be computationally efficient while being accurate. From this viewpoint, this paper proposes a nonlinear state estimation technique based on ensemble Kalman filtering for estimation of harmonics, interharmonics, and subharmonics, all using a single framework and at a time, from distorted power system signal. The proposed technique is computationally efficient compared to conventional Kalman filtering leading to less computational cost and hardware requirement. It is observed from both simulation and experimental studies that the proposed ensemble Kalman filter (KF) approach to estimation of harmonics, interharmonics, and subharmonics in"

Since, payload is a critical parameter of the FLM whose variation greatly influences the controller performance. The proposed controller guarantees stability under change in payload by attenuating the non-modeled higher order dynamics using a new nonlinear autoregressive moving average with exogenous-input (NARMAX) model of the FLM. The parameters of the FLM are identified on-line using recursive least square (RLS) algorithm and using minimum variance control (MVC) laws the control parameters are updated in real-time. This proposed NSPID controller has been implemented in real-time on an experimental set-up.

This proposed adaptive controller consists of a proportional derivative (PD) tracking loop and an actor-critic-based RL loop that adapts the actor and critic weights in response to payload variations while suppressing the tip deflection and tracking the desired trajectory. The actor-critic-based RL loop uses a recursive least square (RLS)-based temporal difference (TD) learning with eligibility trace and an adaptive memory to estimate the critic weights and a gradient-based estimator for estimating actor weights.

Abstract: Diabetes is a chronic disease caused by insulin deficiency, and it should be detected in the early stages for effective treatment. In this paper, the Diabetes-Network (Dia-Net) is proposed to increase diabetes predictive accuracy. The proposed Dia-Net is a dual-stage network. It combines both optimized probabilistic neural network (OPNN) and optimized radial basis function neural network (ORBFNN) in the first stage. Hence, Dia-Net possesses the advantages of both the models. In the second stage, the linear support vector machine is used. As the dataset size increases, both RBFNN and PNN perform better, but both suffers from complexity and computational problems. To address these problems, in this paper, particle swarm optimization-based clustering is employed for discovering centers in high-dense regions. This reduces the size of the hidden layer of both RBFNN and PNNs. Experiments are carried out on the Pima Indians Di"

The uniqueness of lip has been proven by the researchers by using color information and shape analysis. These measures of lip are unique for every person. This paper proposes that grayscale lip images constitute local features. The claim has been experimentally established by extracting local features from 23 grayscale lip images from 10 different subjects and measuring the accuracy of match. There are two techniques applied for extraction and matching of local features from lip, viz. SIFT and SURF. The accuracy turns out to be very high (>90%) in both the experiments conducted. I.

Proposed technique is robust to occlusion, specular reflection, variation in illumination and non-centered gaze. For pupil localisation, the input iris image is binarised using an adaptive threshold determined based on number of connected components. Further, pupil center and radius are obtained using spectrum image based approach. The proposed technique performs accurately (>97%) with low computation (<0.4 seconds/image). It has been observed that the proposed approach can be deployed to real-time biometric systems where time as well as accuracy cannot be compromised.

The medium for non-visual representation of an image is chosen to be sound due to well developed auditory sensing ability of human beings and wide availability of cheap audio hardware. Visionary information of an image can be conveyed to blind and partially sighted persons through auditory representation of the image within some of the known limitations of human hearing system.

We present a novel HTL algorithm that works even where there are no shared features, instance correspondences and further, the two domains do not have identical labels. We utilize the label relationships via web-distance to align the data of the domains in the projected space, while preserving the structure of the original data. Introduction Traditional supervised algorithms require sufficient labeled data to learn a computational model for making reliable predictions. Often, obtaining labeled training data is expensive and time consuming.

Our algorithm uses the shared label distributions present across the domains as pivots for learning a sparse feature transformation. The shared label distributions and the relationship between the feature spaces and the label distributions are estimated in a supervised manner using random forests.

Topologically, the nodes in the core of a network are the most efficient spreaders. However, these nodes are less susceptible, i.e., unlikely to be influenced by the periphery nodes. Consequently, large payoffs are required to market information (ideas, products, memes, etc.) via them. In this paper, we show the presence of several non-core nodes whose spreading power is close to that of the core nodes. In the 4 real-world datasets under consideration, the number of such nodes is 7 times more than the number of core nodes on average. Given a "

Recent leading approaches for unsupervised domain adaptation are based on adversarial alignment. Aligning the global distribution of the domain representations via adversarial training does not guarantee the classwise distribution alignment. The proposed approach is built on adversarial learning with the focus on carefully aligning class-wise domain representations. Our algorithm utilizes the pseudo-labels (the predicted labels) of the target features to stimulate class-wise alignment. As the pseudo-labels of individual target features can be erroneous, instead of iteratively aligning individual target samples, the proposed framework introduces a generic class-"

As the information being searched over the internet is rapidly increasing, users often face the difficulty of finding items of his/her own interest and RS often provides help in such tasks. Recent studies show that, as the item space increases, and the number of items rated by the users become very less, issues like sparsity arise. To mitigate the sparsity problem, transfer learning techniques are being used wherein the data from dense domain(source) is considered in order to predict the missing entries in the sparse domain(target). In this paper, we propose a transfer learning approach for cross-domain recommendation when both domains have no overlap of users and items.

This type of application is particularly suited for rural areas that have a considerable amount of solar radiation and have no access to grid systems. The proposed system is comprised of a photovoltaic (PV) array, DC-DC boost converter and DC-DC buck converter. Two Permanent Magnet Brushless Direct Current (PMBLDC) motors are employed to drive a centrifugal water pump and an air blower coupled to their individual shafts. The air blower is connected with a DCDC boost converter that ensures a maximum power point (MPP) operation. A centrifugal water pump is connected with a DC-DC buck converter. The challenging task in an air cooling system is to maintain the constant speed of the blower under variable irradiance conditions. The power provided by the solar PV array can be"

This article attempts to look at the importance to understand the required fundamental learning skills such as creative skill, critical skill etc. that facilitate the incorporation of knowledge appropriately. Thus, it is needed that a course must be studied systematically in terms of the required learning skills. In this paper, we present a novel evaluation scheme for a course that focus on the various sets of learning skills required for each concept of the course. We employ Formal Concept Analysis on a complete set of questions prepared by experts covering all the concepts of a given course. This procedure generates a lattice of formal concepts, each presenting a group of questions that involve a common circle of learning skills to resolve them. These formal concepts can serve as performance parameters for assessing the students in a skill centric fashion. Keywords: Learning Skills, Evaluation"

The system acknowledges a distinct set of students' aims that prioritize various Learning Objects (LOs) such as theory, case studies etc. according to student's Learning Aim (LA). We also propose a new way to model the course as a directed acyclic graph in which nodes at each level represent a collection of different perspectives for the same concept. All concept perspectives encapsulate a set of LOs. This allows students to strengthen their learning along both dimensions; depth of coverage as well as perspective breadth by suitably adding to her repertoire of multiple viewpoints contributed by different authors on the same concept.

It caters to a wide spectrum of students with diverse backgrounds who enroll with their own learning aims. A core challenge under this scenario is to generate personalized learning paths so that each student can achieve her learning aim most effectively. Prior works used static attributes such as prior knowledge level, learning ability, browsing preferences, learning style etc. to generate personalized learning paths. In this paper, we take an entirely new route by taking into account the continuous improvement of a learner in the light of her own learning aim, to redefine her learning path at each level of the course.

Pal, Fellow, IEEE Abstract—We propose a new archive-based steady-state micro genetic algorithm (ASMiGA). In this context, a new archive maintenance strategy is proposed, which maintains a set of nondominated solutions in the archive unless the archive size falls below a minimum allowable size. It makes the archive size adaptive and dynamic. We have proposed a new environmental selection strategy and a new mating selection strategy. The environmental selection strategy reduces the exploration in less probable objective spaces. The mating selection increases searching in more probable search regions by enhancing the exploitation of existing solutions. A new crossover strategy DE-3 is proposed here. ASMiGA is compared with five well-known multiobjective optimization algorithms of different types—generational evolutionary algorithms (SPEA2 and NSGA-II), archive-based hybrid scatter search, decomposition-based evolutionary approach, and archive-based micro genetic algorithm.

Pal, Senior Member, IEEE Abstract—This paper presents a self-organized genetic algorithm-based rule generation (SOGARG) method for fuzzy logic controllers. It is a three-stage hierarchical scheme that does not require any expert knowledge and input-output data. The first stage selects rules required to control the system in the vicinity of the set point. The second stage starts with the rules resulted from the first stage and extends its span of operation to the entire input space. Thus, the second stage ends up with a rulebase that can bring the system to its set point from almost all initial states of the input space. The third stage then refines the rulebase and reduces the number of rules in the rulebase. The first two stages use the same fitness function whose aim is only to acquire the controllability, but the last stage uses a"

Based on the knowledge of memristor and recurrent neural networks, the model of MNNs is established. Then, considering the state-dependent properties of memristor, a fuzzy model of MNNs is employed to provide a new way of analyzing the complicated MNNs with only two subsystems, and update laws for the connection weights of slave systems and controller gain are designed to make the slave systems exponentially lag synchronized with the master systems. Two examples about synchronization problems are presented to show the effectiveness of the obtained results, and an application of the obtained theory is also given in the pseudorandom number generator.

The controller is dependent on the output of the system in the case of packed circuits, since it is hard to measure the inner state of the circuits. Thus, it is critical to design the controller based on the neuron activation function. Comparing the results, in this paper, with the existing ones shows that we improve and generalize the results derived in the previous literature. Several examples are also given to illustrate the effectiveness and potential applications in image encryption. Index Terms— Exponential stability, lag synchronization, switched neural networks. I.

PP, IN PRESS, 2014 1 Off-policy Reinforcement Learning for H∞ Control Design Biao Luo, Huai-Ning Wu and Tingwen Huang Abstract—The H∞ control design problem is considered for nonlinear systems with unknown internal system model. It is known that the nonlinear H∞ control problem can be transformed into solving the so-called Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs (HJI) equation, which is a nonlinear partial differential equation that is generally impossible to be solved analytically. Even worse, modelbased approaches cannot be used for approximately solving HJI equation, when the accurate system model is unavailable or costly to obtain in practice. To overcome these difficulties, an off-policy reinforcement leaning (RL) method is introduced to learn the solution of HJI equation from real system data instead of mathematical system model, and its convergence is proved. In the off-policy RL method, the system data can be generated with arbitrary policies rather than the evaluating policy, which is extremely important and promising for practical systems. For implementation purpose, a neural network ("

In this paper, we present a simple method for automatically detection and classification of ECG noises. The proposed method consists of four major steps: moving average filter, blocking, feature extraction, and multistage decision-tree algorithm. In the proposed method, the dynamic amplitude range and autocorrelation maximum peak features are extracted for each block. In the first decision stage, a amplitude-dependent decision rule is used for detecting the presence of low-frequency (LF) noise (including, baseline wander (BW) and abrupt change (ABC) artifacts) and the high-frequency (HF) noise (including, power line interference (PLI) and muscle artifacts).

E-mail: us11@iitbbs.ac.in Parthapratim De Department of Electrical Engineering Shaqra University Al-Dawadmi, KSA. E-mail: pd4267@yahoo.com Abstract—Cognitive Radios exploit the unutilized spectrum by transmitting opportunistically without disturbing the primary user (PU) or licensed user. So, the sensing should be fast enough that the secondary user (SU) can vacate the spectrum when the PU becomes active. Cyclostationary methods perform better than energy detection methods in low SNR scenarios but they require large number of symbols. The objective of this paper to reduce the number of measurements in blind spectrum sensing (using QR decomposition and backward linear prediction) by employing multiple receive antennas. By using compressed sensing at the receiver front end helps to reduce the complexity of the A/D converter. Furthermore, in this paper, simulation results show that our method achieves a good probability of detection in very low SNR even at 50% measurements which is comparable to probability of detect"

Manikandan School of Electrical Sciences Indian Institute of Techonology Bhubaneswar, INDIA Email: {mm10,us11,barathram,msm}@iitbbs.ac.in Abstract—In recent years, automatic signal detection and modulation classification play a vital role in the field of cognitive radio applications. The majority of the existing signals detection and classification methods assume that the received signal is contaminated by additive white Gaussian noise. Under impulsive noise condition, the performance of the traditional modulation classification methods may be degraded. Therefore, in this paper, we investigate the application of sparse signal decomposition using an overcomplete dictionary for detection and classification of digital modulation signals. The overcomplete hybrid dictionary consists of impulse waveform and sine and cosine waveform for effectively capturing morphological components of the impulse noise and deterministic modulated signals. The proposed modulation classification method includes the following st"

Manikandan and Barathram Ramkumar School of Electrical Sciences Indian Institute of Technology Bhubaneswar, India {us11, msm, barathram}@iitbbs.ac.in Abstract—Automatic Modulation Classification (AMC) is a essential component in Cognitive Radio (CR) for recognizing the modulation scheme. Many modulated signals manifest the property of cyclostationarity as a feature so it can be exploited for classification. In this paper, we study the performance of digital modulation classification technique based on the cyclostationary features and different classifiers such as Neural Network, Support Vector Machine, k-Nearest Neighbor, Naive Bayes, Linear Discriminant Analysis and Neuro-Fuzzy classifier. In this study we considered modulations i.e. BPSK, QPSK, FSK and MSK for classification. All classification methods studied using performance matrix including classification accuracy and computational complexity (time). The robustness of these methods are studied with SNR ranging from 0 to 20dB. Based upon the result we found that combining cyclostationary features with Naive Bayes and Line"

So rapid sensing is required under the consideration that the secondary users (SU) have to vacate the spectrum within very less time, whenever the primary user(PU) is active. Cyclo-stationary based spectrum sensing methods are better than energy detection methods in negative signal-to-noise (SNR) decibel (dB) regime, in which case the noise variance cannot be exactly estimated. However blind cyclo-stationary methods require a large number of symbols (and hence measurements). The paper aims to reduce the number of measurements in a blind sensing method (using a combination of linear prediction"

We use a form called punctuator which is non-propositional and also non-set theoretic to build our system – Neo-Vaiśesika Formal Ontology. The idea is to present an ontological language which is formal. This language is a set of potentially infinite sentences (graphs) whose structure is captured by a finite set of (graph) grammar rules. We also have an interpreter to interpret the graphs generated by this grammar and show that the interpretation of a node as belonging to a particular ontological category is based purely on its structure/form and nothing else to provide a robust example of a formal, foundational and generative ontology.

Formal Ontology, Graph Grammar, Generative Ontology, Punctuator, Generative Grammar, Vaiśesika Introduction Most, if not all, of the (computational) ontologies built till now [12] are either built manually"

Topologically, the nodes in the core of a network are the most efficient spreaders. However, these nodes are less susceptible, i.e., unlikely to be influenced by the periphery nodes. Consequently, large payoffs are required to market information (ideas, products, memes, etc.) via them. In this paper, we show the presence of several non-core nodes whose spreading power is close to that of the core nodes. In the 4 real-world datasets under consideration, the number of such nodes is 7 times more than the number of core nodes on average. Given a "

However, their coexistence and collective dynamics are not well understood. Communities represent dense connections between a set of nodes. On the other hand, the core of a network encompasses the influential nodes (superspreaders). It is not well understood whether a community comprises equally influential nodes or nodes from a spectrum of influential powers. We propose various metrics to quantify the influence composition of communities in a network. Shell number (aka coreness: maximal core number of a node), calculated using K-shell decomposition algorithm, has been used as an indicator of influence. We also quantify the influential power of a community as a whole. Most of the communities, specifically influential communities, are observed to possess varying levels of"

This study focuses on understanding the various techniques and algorithms that are used to model real-life recommendation systems. We present a recommendation engine for Amazon products that uses collaborative filtering (CF). Given a list of users and their reviews of Amazon products, our CF-based recommendation engine generates a ranked list of the top k products for individual users. The generated recommendations are based on the preferences of similar users and past purchases. We have created two such systems: a memory-based user-item CF system and a model-based CF system that utilizes matrix factorization techniques. Additionally, we also propose a graph-based recommendation technique that generates a lis"

Although a plethora of performance metrics have been proposed in the MOO context, there has been a lack of insights on the relationships between metrics. In this paper, we first group the major MOO metrics proposed to date according to four core performance criteria considered in the literature, namely Capacity, Convergence, Diversity, and Convergence–Diversity. Then, a comprehensive study is conducted to investigate the relationships among representative group metrics, including Generational Distance (GD), ϵ-indicator (I1ϵ+), Spread (∆), Generalized Spread (∆∗), Inverted Generational Distance (IGD) and Hypervolume (HV). Experimental results indicated that these six metrics show high consistencies when Pareto fronts (PFs) are convex, whereas they show certain contradictions"

The essential backbone of our framework is an evolutionary algorithm coupled with a feasible sequential quadratic programming solver in the spirit of Lamarckian learning. We employ a trust-region approach for interleaving use of exact models for the objectiveand constraint functionswith computationallycheap surrogatemodels during local search. In contrast to earlier work, we construct local surrogate models using radial basis functions motivated by the principle of transductive inference.

Recent surrogate-assisted evolutionary frameworks have relied on the use of a variety of different modeling approaches to approximate the complex problem landscape. From these recent studies, one main research issue is with the choice of modeling scheme used, which has been found to affect the performance of evolutionary search significantly. Given that theoretical knowledge available for making a decision on an approximation model a priori is very much limited, this paper describes a generalization of surrogateassisted evolutionary frameworks for optimization of problems with objectives and constraints that are computationally expensive to evaluate.

Despite the implicit parallelism of population-based search, no attempt has yet been made to multitask, i.e., to solve multiple optimization problems simultaneously using a single population of evolving individuals. Accordingly, this paper introduces evolutionary multitasking as a new paradigm in the field of optimization and evolutionary computation. We first formalize the concept of evolutionary multitasking and then propose an algorithm to handle such problems. The methodology is inspired by bio-cultural models of multifactorial inheritance, which explain the transmission of complex developmental traits to offspring through the interactions of genetic and cultural factors. Furthermore, we develop a cross-domain optimization platform that allows one to solve diverse problems concurrently. The numerical experiments reveal several p"

In the meanwhile, it poses challenges for the Gaussian process (GP) regression, a well-known non-parametric and interpretable Bayesian model, which suffers from cubic complexity to data size. To improve the scalability while retaining desirable prediction quality, a variety of scalable GPs have been presented. But they have not yet been comprehensively reviewed and analyzed in order to be well understood by both academia and industry. The review of scalable GPs in the GP community is timely and important due to the explosion of data size. To this end, this paper is devoted to the review on state-of-the-art scalable GPs involving two main categories: global approximations which distillate the entire data and local approximations which divide the data for subspace learning.

It incorporates filter ranking method in the traditional genetic algorithm to improve classification performance and accelerate the search in identifying the core feature subsets. Particularly, the method adds or deletes a feature from a candidate feature subset based on the univariate feature ranking information. Our empirical study on commonly used datasets from the UCI repository and microarray datasets show that the proposed method outperforms existing methods in terms of classification accuracy, number of selected features and computational efficiency. Further, we investigate several major issues of memetic algorithm to identify a good balance between local and genetic search so as to maximize search quality and efficiency in the hybrid filter and wrapper memetic algorithm.
